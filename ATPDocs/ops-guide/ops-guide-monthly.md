# Monthly operational guide - Microsoft Defender for Identity

This article reviews the Microsoft Defender for Identity activities we recommend for your team on a monthly basis.

## Review Microsoft service health

**Where**: Check the following locations:

- In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Health > Service health**
- [Microsoft 365 Service health status](https://status.office365.com/)
- X: https://twitter.com/MSFT365status

**Persona**: Security and compliance administrators

If you're experiencing issues with a cloud service, we recommend checking service health updates to determine whether it's a known issue, with a resolution in progress, before you call support or spend time troubleshooting.

For more information, see [Review Defender for Identity health issues](ops-guide-daily.md#review-defender-for-identity-health-issues).

## Review tuned alerts and adjust tuning if needed

**Where**: In Microsoft Defender XDR, select **Hunting > Advanced hunting**

**Persona**: Security and compliance administrators, SOC analysts

Microsoft Defender XDR allows you to *tune* alerts, helping you reduce the number of alerts you need to triage. Tuning alerts resolves alerts automatically based on your configurations and rule conditions.

We recommend reviewing your tuning configurations regularly to make sure that they're still relevant and effective. For example:

- Check to see if your existing rules have matches as expected
- If a rule has no matches, consider whether you still need it or if you can remove it

For more information, see [Investigate Defender for Identity security alerts in Microsoft Defender XDR](../manage-security-alerts.md).

## Track new changes in Microsoft Defender XDR and Defender for Identity

**Where**:

- In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Health > Message center**. For more information, see [Track new and changed features in the Microsoft 365 Message center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center).

# What's new in Microsoft Defender for Identity

This article is updated frequently to let you know what's new in the latest releases of Microsoft Defender for Identity.

[!INCLUDE [automatic-redirect](../includes/automatic-redirect.md)]

## What's new scope and references

Defender for Identity releases are deployed gradually across customer tenants. If there's a feature documented here that you don't see yet in your tenant, check back later for the update.

For more information, see also:

- [What's new in Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/whats-new)
- [What's new in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/whats-new-in-microsoft-defender-endpoint)
- [What's new in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/release-notes)

For updates about versions and features released six months ago or earlier, see the [What's new archive for Microsoft Defender for Identity](whats-new-archive.md).

## July 2024
6 New detections are new in public preview:
* Possible NetSync attack
    * NetSync is a module in Mimikatz, a post-exploitation tool, that requests the password hash of a target device's password by pretending to be a domain controller. An attacker might be performing malicious activities inside the network using this feature to gain access to the organization's resources.
* Possible takeover of a Microsoft Entra seamless SSO account
    * A Microsoft Entra seamless SSO (single sign-on) account object, AZUREADSSOACC, was modified suspiciously. An attacker might be moving laterally from the on-premises environment to the cloud.
* Suspicious LDAP query
    * A suspicious Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) query associated with a known attack tool was detected. An attacker might be performing reconnaissance for later steps.
* Suspicious SPN was added to a user
    * A suspicious service principal name (SPN) was added to a sensitive user. An attacker might be attempting to gain elevated access for lateral movement within the organization
* Suspicious creation of ESXi group
    * A suspicious VMWare ESXi group was created in the domain. This might indicate that an attacker is trying to get more permissions for later steps in an attack.
* Suspicious ADFS authentication
    * A domain-joined account signed in using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) from a suspicious IP address. An attacker might have stolen a user's credentials and is using it to move laterally in the organization.

### New security posture assessment for insecure AD CS IIS endpoint configuration

Defender for Identity has added the new **Edit insecure ADCS certificate enrollment IIS endpoints (ESC8)** recommendation in Microsoft Secure Score.

Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) supports certificate enrollment through various methods and protocols, including enrollment via HTTP using the Certificate Enrollment Service (CES) or the Web Enrollment interface (Certsrv). Insecure configurations of the CES or Certsrv IIS endpoints might create vulnerabilities to relay attacks (ESC8).

The new **Edit insecure ADCS certificate enrollment IIS endpoints (ESC8)** recommendation is added to other AD CS-related recommendations recently released. Together, these assessments offer security posture reports that surface security issues and severe misconfigurations that post risks to the entire organization, together with related detections.

For more information, see:

- [Security assessment: Edit insecure ADCS certificate enrollment IIS endpoints (ESC8)](security-assessment-insecure-adcs-certificate-enrollment.md)
- [Security posture assessments for AD CS sensors](#security-posture-assessments-for-ad-cs-sensors-preview)
- [Microsoft Defender for Identity's security posture assessments](security-assessment.md)

### Defender for Identity release 2.229

This version includes improvements and bug fixes for cloud services and the Defender for Identity sensor.

### Enhanced user experience for adjusting alert thresholds (Preview)

The Defender for Identity **Advanced Settings** page is now renamed to **Adjust alert thresholds** and provides a refreshed experience with enhanced flexibility for adjusting alert thresholds.

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/adjust-alert-thresholds.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Adjust alert thresholds page." lightbox="media/whats-new/adjust-alert-thresholds.png":::

Changes include:

- We've removed the previous **Remove learning period** option, and added a new **Recommended test mode** option. Select **Recommended test mode** to set all threshold levels to **Low**, increasing the number of alerts, and sets all other threshold levels to read-only.

- The previous **Sensitivity level** column is now renamed as **Threshold level**, with newly defined values. By default, all alerts are set to a **High** threshold, which represents the default behavior and a standard alert configuration.

The following table lists the mapping between the previous **Sensitivity level** values and the new **Threshold level** values:

|Sensitivity level (previous name) |Threshold level (new name) |
|---------|---------|
|**Normal**     |  **High**       |
|**Medium**      |  **Medium**       |
|**High**      |  **Low**       |

If you had specific values defined on the **Advanced Settings** page, we've transferred them to the new **Adjust alert thresholds** page as follows:

|Advanced settings page configuration  |New Adjust alert thresholds page configuration  |
|---------|---------|
|**Remove learning period** toggled on     |  **Recommended test mode** toggled off. <br><br> Alert threshold configuration settings remain the same.       |
|**Remove learning period** toggled off      |  **Recommended test mode** toggled off. <br><br> Alert threshold configuration settings are all reset to their default values, with a **High** threshold level.   |

Alerts are always triggered immediately if the **Recommended test mode** option is selected, or if a threshold level is set to **Medium** or **Low**, regardless of whether the alert's learning period has already completed.

For more information, see [Adjust alert thresholds](advanced-settings.md).

### Device details pages now include device descriptions (Preview)

Microsoft Defender XDR now includes device descriptions on device details panes and device details pages. The descriptions are populated from the device's Active Directory [Description](/windows/win32/adschema/a-description) attribute.

For example, on the device details side pane:

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/device-description.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Device description field on a device details pane." lightbox="media/whats-new/device-description.png":::

## September 2023

### Decreased number of alerts for Remote Code Execution Attempts

To better align Defender for Identity and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts, we updated the detection logic for the Defender for Identity [Remote code execution attempt](other-alerts.md#remote-code-execution-attempt-external-id-2019) detections. 

While this change results in a decreased number of *Remote code execution attempt* alerts, Defender for Identity continues to record the remote code execution activities. Customers can continue to build their own [advanced hunting queries](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-overview) and create [custom detection policies](/microsoft-365/security/defender/custom-detection-rules). 

### Alert sensitivity settings and learning period enhancements

Some Defender for Identity alerts wait for a *learning period* before alerts are triggered, while building a profile of patterns to use when distinguishing between legitimate and suspicious activities.

Defender for Identity now provides the following enhancements for the learning period experience:

- Administrators can now use the **Remove learning period** setting to configure the sensitivity used for specific alerts. Define the sensitivity as *Normal* to configure the **Remove learning period** setting as *Off* for the selected type of alert. 

- After you deploy a new sensor in a new Defender for Identity workspace, the **Remove learning period** setting is automatically turned *On* for 30 days. When 30 days are complete, the **Remove learning period** setting is automatically turned *Off,* and alert sensitivity levels are returned to their default functionality.

   To have Defender for Identity use standard learning period functionality, where alerts aren't generated until the learning period is done, configure the **Remove learning periods** setting to *Off*.

If you'd previously updated the **Remove learning period** setting, your setting remains as you'd configured it.

For more information, see [Advanced settings](advanced-settings.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Advanced Settings** page originally listed the *Account enumeration reconnaissance* alert under the **Remove learning period** options as configurable for sensitivity settings. This alert was removed from the list and is replaced by the *Security principal reconnaissance (LDAP)* alert. This user interface bug was fixed in November 2023.
>

### Defender for Identity release 2.215

This version includes improvements and bug fixes for cloud services and the Defender for Identity sensor.

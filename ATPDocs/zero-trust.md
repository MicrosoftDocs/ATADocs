# Zero Trust with Defender for Identity

[Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview) is a security strategy for designing and implementing the following sets of security principles:

|Verify explicitly  |Use least privilege access  |Assume breach  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.     | Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.        | Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.        |

Defender for Identity is a primary component of a Zero Trust strategy and your XDR deployment with Microsoft 365 Defender. Defender for Identity uses Active Directory signals to detect sudden account changes like privilege escalation or high-risk lateral movement, and reports on easily exploited identity issues like unconstrained Kerberos delegation, for correction by the security team.

## Monitoring for Zero Trust

When monitoring for Zero Trust, make sure review and mitigate open alerts from Defender for Identity together with your other security operations. You may also want to use [advanced hunting queries in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-overview) to look for threats across identities, devices, and cloud apps.

For example, you can use advanced hunting to discover an attacker's [lateral movement paths](../understand-lateral-movement-paths.md), and then see if the same identity has been involved in other detections.

> [!TIP]
> Ingest your alerts into [Microsoft Sentinel with Microsoft 365 Defender](/azure/sentinel/microsoft-365-defender-sentinel-integration), a cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution to provide your Security Operations Center (SOC) with a single pane of glass for monitoring security events across your enterprise.

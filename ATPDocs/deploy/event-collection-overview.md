# Event collection with Microsoft Defender for Identity

A Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor is configured to automatically collect syslog events. For Windows events, Defender for Identity detection relies on specific event logs. The sensor parses these event logs from your domain controllers.

## Event collection for domain controllers, AD FS servers, and AD CS servers

For the correct events to be audited and included in the Windows event log, your domain controllers, Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers, or Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) servers require accurate Advanced Audit Policy settings.

For more information, see [Configure audit policies for Windows event logs](../configure-windows-event-collection.md).

## Reference of required events

This section lists the Windows events that the Defender for Identity sensor requires when it's installed on AD FS servers, AD CS servers, or domain controllers.

### Required AD FS events

The following events are required for AD FS servers:

- 1202 - The Federation Service validated a new credential
- 1203 - The Federation Service failed to validate a new credential
- 4624 - An account was successfully logged on
- 4625 - An account failed to log on

For more information, see [Configure auditing on Active Directory Federation Services](../configure-windows-event-collection.md#configure-auditing-on-active-directory-federation-services).

### Required AD CS events

The following events are required for AD CS servers:

- 4870: Certificate Services revoked a certificate
- 4882: The security permissions for Certificate Services changed
- 4885: The audit filter for Certificate Services changed
- 4887: Certificate Services approved a certificate request and issued a certificate
- 4888: Certificate Services denied a certificate request
- 4890: The certificate manager settings for Certificate Services changed
- 4896: One or more rows have been deleted from the certificate database

For more information, see [Configure auditing for Active Directory Certificate Services](../configure-windows-event-collection.md#configure-auditing-for-active-directory-certificate-services).

### Required Microsoft Entra Connect events

The following event is required for Microsoft Entra Connect servers:

- 4624 - An account was successfully logged on

For more information, see [Configure auditing on Microsoft Entra Connect](../configure-windows-event-collection.md#configure-auditing-for-entra-connect).

### Other required Windows events

The following general Windows events are required for all Defender for Identity sensors:

- 4662 - An operation was performed on an object
- 4726 - User Account Deleted
- 4728 - Member Added to Global Security Group
- 4729 - Member Removed from Global Security Group
- 4730 - Global Security Group Deleted
- 4732 - Member Added to Local Security Group
- 4733 - Member Removed from Local Security Group
- 4741 - Computer Account Added
- 4743 - Computer Account Deleted
- 4753 - Global Distribution Group Deleted
- 4756 - Member Added to Universal Security Group
- 4757 - Member Removed from Universal Security Group
- 4758 - Universal Security Group Deleted
- 4763 - Universal Distribution Group Deleted
- 4776 - Domain Controller Attempted to Validate Credentials for an Account (NTLM)
- 5136 - A directory service object was modified
- 7045 - New Service Installed
- 8004 - NTLM Authentication

For more information, see [Configure NTLM auditing](../configure-windows-event-collection.md#configure-ntlm-auditing) and [Configure domain object auditing](../configure-windows-event-collection.md#configure-domain-object-auditing).

### Event collection for standalone sensors

If you're working with a standalone Defender for Identity sensor, configure event collection manually by using one of the following methods:

- [Listen for security information and event management (SIEM) events on your Defender for Identity standalone sensor](configure-event-collection.md). Defender for Identity supports User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic from your SIEM system or your syslog server.
- [Configure Windows event forwarding to your Defender for Identity standalone sensor](configure-event-forwarding.md). When you're forwarding syslog data to a standalone sensor, make sure not to forward *all* syslog data to your sensor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Defender for Identity standalone sensors don't support the collection of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) log entries that provide the data for multiple detections. For full coverage of your environment, we recommend deploying the Defender for Identity sensor.

For more information, see the product documentation for your SIEM system or your syslog server.

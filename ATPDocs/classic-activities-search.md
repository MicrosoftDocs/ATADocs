[!INCLUDE [automatic-redirect](../includes/automatic-redirect.md)]

Activities detected by Defender for Identity on your network can be searched and filtered for easy drill-down and organization during your research and investigation into security alerts.

From the Defender for Identity timeline, select any entity in your network (DC, machine, or user) as the filter access point. Next, select to filter by the **Security Alert**, **Activity** type, or any combination. Once the filter is applied, the threat timeline of the entity is updated with the filtered information. Your filtered alerts and activities can also be downloaded to continue your investigation or tracking in other tools.

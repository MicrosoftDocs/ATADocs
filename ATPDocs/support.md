# Microsoft Defender for Identity support

This article provides information about support, troubleshooting options, and community resources.

## Support options and community resources

### Microsoft Support

To contact Microsoft Support:

If you have Premier Support, visit the [portal for Premier Support customers](https://premier.microsoft.com/) to submit incidents, browse solutions, and get help.

For other customers, use the support widget as follows:

### Prerequisites

It's important to know the specific roles that have permission to open support cases.

At a minimum, you must have a Service Support Administrator **OR** Helpdesk Administrator role.

For more information on which roles have permission, see, [Security Administrator permissions](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#security-administrator). Roles that include the action `microsoft.office365.supportTickets/allEntities/allTasks` can submit a case.

For general information on admin roles, see [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### Access the widget

Accessing the new support widget can be done in one of two ways:

1. Selecting the question mark on the top right of the portal and then selecting "Microsoft support":

2. Selecting the **Need help?** button in the bottom right of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal:

   :::image type="content" source="media/need-help-option.png" alt-text="The Need help button" lightbox="media/need-help-option.png":::

In the widget you'll be offered two options:

- Find solutions to common problems
- Open a service request

### Find solutions to common problems

This option includes articles that might be related to the question you may ask. Just start typing the question in the search box and articles related to your search will be surfaced.

:::image type="content" source="media/contactsupport1.png" alt-text="How can we help?" lightbox="media/contactsupport1.png":::

In case the suggested articles aren't sufficient, you can open a service request by selecting **Contact support** at the bottom of the pane.

### Open a service request

Learn how to open support tickets by contacting Defender for Identity support.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a premier support contract with Microsoft, you'll see the premier tag on the widget. If not, contact your Microsoft account manager.

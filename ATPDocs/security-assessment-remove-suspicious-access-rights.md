# Security assessment: Remove access rights on suspicious accounts with the Admin SDHolder permission

This article describes the **Remove access rights on suspicious accounts with the Admin SDHolder permission** security assessment, which highlights risky access rights on suspicious accounts.

## Why might the Admin SDHolder permission be risky?

Having non-sensitive accounts with **Admin SDHolder** (security descriptor holder) permissions can have significant security implications, including:

- Leading to unauthorized privilege escalation, where attackers can exploit these accounts to gain administrative access and compromise sensitive systems or data
- Increasing the attack surface, making it harder to track and mitigate security incidents, potentially exposing the organization to greater risks.

## How do I use this security assessment to improve my organizational security posture?

1. Review the recommended action at <https://security.microsoft.com/securescore?viewid=actions> for **Remove access rights on suspicious accounts with the Admin SDHolder permission**.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/secure-score/remove-suspicious-access-rights.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Admin SDHolder security assessment." lightbox="media/secure-score/remove-suspicious-access-rights.png":::

1. Review the list of exposed entities to discover which of your non-sensitive accounts have the **Admin SDHolder** permission.

1. Take appropriate action on those entities by removing their privileged access rights. For example:

    1. Use the **ADSI Edit** tool to connect to your domain controller.
    1. Browse to the **CN=System**> **CN=Admin** container and open the **CN=Admin** container properties.
    1. Select the **Security** tab > **Advanced**, and remove any non-sensitive entities. These are the entities marked as exposed in the security assessment.

    For more information, see [Active Directory Service Interfaces](/windows/win32/adsi/active-directory-service-interfaces-adsi) and [ADSI Edit](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc773354(v=ws.10)) documentation

To achieve the full score, remediate all exposed entities.

# Microsoft Defender for Identity role groups

Microsoft Defender for Identity offers role-based security to safeguard data according to an organization's specific security and compliance needs. Defender for Identity support three separate roles: Administrators, Users, and Viewers.

Role groups enable access management for Defender for Identity. Using role groups, you can segregate duties within your security team, and grant only the amount of access that users need to do their jobs. This article explains access management, Defender for Identity role authorization, and helps you get up and running with role groups in Defender for Identity.

> [!NOTE]
> Any global administrator or security administrator on the tenant's Microsoft Entra ID is automatically a Defender for Identity administrator.

## Unified role-based access control (RBAC)

You can now enable more granular role-based access control from the Microsoft 365 portal instead of using Defender for Identity's Microsoft Entra ID groups. For more information, see [Custom roles in role-based access control for Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/custom-roles).

> [!NOTE]
> Once enabled, you can migrate existing Defender for Identity roles to the new format. However, if you change or add new roles, they must match these permissions to the role table to access the classic Defender for Identity experience.

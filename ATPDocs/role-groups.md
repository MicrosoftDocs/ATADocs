# Microsoft Defender for Identity role groups

Microsoft Defender for Identity offers role-based security to safeguard data according to your organization's specific security and compliance needs. We recommend that you use role groups to manage access to Defender for Identity, segregating responsibilities across your security team and granting only the amount of access that users need to do their jobs.

## Unified role-based access control (RBAC)

Users that are already [Global Administrators](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference) or [Security Administrators](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference) on your tenant's Microsoft Entra ID are also automatically Defender for Identity administrator. Microsoft Entra Global and Security Administrators don't need extra permissions to access Defender for Identity.

For other users, enable and use Microsoft 365 role-based access control (RBAC) to create custom roles and to support more Entra ID roles such as Security operator or Security Reader by default to manage access to Defender for Identity.

When creating your custom roles, make sure that you apply the permissions listed in the following table:

|Defender for Identity access level | Minimum required Microsoft 365 unified RBAC permissions      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|**Administrators**                             | - `Authorization and settings/Security settings/Read` <br/>- `Authorization and settings/Security settings/All permissions` <br/> - `Authorization and settings/System settings/Read`<br/>- `Authorization and settings/System settings/All permissions`<br/> - `Security operations/Security data/Alerts (manage)`<br/> -`Security operations/Security data /Security data basics (Read)`<br/>- `Authorization and settings/Authorization/All permissions` <br> - `Authorization and settings/Authorization/Read` |
|**Users**                               | - `Security operations/Security data /Security data basics (Read)`<br/>- `Authorization and settings/System settings/Read`<br/>- `Authorization and settings/Security settings/Read`<br/>- `Security operations/Security data/Alerts (manage)`<br/>- `microsoft.xdr/configuration/security/manage` |
|**Viewers**                            | - `Security operations/Security data /Security data basics (Read)`<br/>- `Authorization and settings / System settings (Read and manage)` <br>- `Authorization and settings / Security setting (All permissions)` |

For more information, see [Custom roles in role-based access control for Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/custom-roles) and [Create custom roles with Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC](/microsoft-365/security/defender/create-custom-rbac-roles).

> [!NOTE]
> Information included from the [Defender for Cloud Apps activity log](classic-mcas-integration.md#activities) may still contain Defender for Identity data. This content adheres to existing Defender for Cloud Apps permissions.
> 
> Exception: If you have configured [Scoped deployment](/defender-cloud-apps/scoped-deployment) for Microsoft Defender for Identity alerts in the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps portal, these permissions do not carry over and you will have to explicitly grant the Security operations \ Security data \ Security data basics (read) permissions for the relevant portal users.

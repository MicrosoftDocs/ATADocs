# What's new archive for Microsoft Defender for Identity

This article lists Microsoft Defender for Identity release notes for versions and features released over 6 months ago.

For information about the latest versions and features, see [What's new in Microsoft Defender for Identity](whats-new.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting June 15 2022, Microsoft will no longer support the Defender for Identity sensor on devices running Windows Server 2008 R2. We recommend that you identify any remaining Domain Controllers (DCs) or (AD FS) servers that are still running Windows Server 2008 R2 as an operating system and make plans to update them to a supported operating system.
>
>For the two months after June 15 2022, the sensor will continue to function. After this two-month period, starting August 15, 2022, the sensor will no longer function on Windows Server 2008 R2 platforms. More details can be found at: <https://aka.ms/mdi/2008r2>

## November 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.194

Released November 10, 2022

- New health alert for verifying that Directory Services Advanced Auditing is configured correctly, as described in the [health alerts page](health-alerts.md#directory-services-advanced-auditing-is-not-enabled-as-required).

- Some of the changes introduced in [Defender for Identity release 2.191](#defender-for-identity-release-2191) regarding honeytoken alerts were not enabled properly. Those issues have been resolved now.

- From the end of November, manual integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is no longer supported. However, we highly recommend using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>) which has the integration built in.

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## October 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.193

Released October 30, 2022

- **New security alert: Abnormal Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) authentication using a suspicious certificate**  
This new technique is linked with the infamous NOBELIUM actor and was dubbed "MagicWeb" – it allows an adversary to implant a backdoor on compromised AD FS servers, which will enable impersonation as any domain user and thus access to external resources.
To learn more about this attack, read [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-defender-blog/protect-your-environment-against-hybrid-identity-attacks/ba-p/3646450).

- Defender for Identity can now use the LocalSystem account on the domain controller to perform remediation actions (enable/disable user, force user reset password), in addition to the gMSA option that was available before. This enables out of the box support for remediation actions. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity action accounts](deploy/manage-action-accounts.md).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.192

Released October 23, 2022

- New health alert for verifying that the NTLM Auditing is enabled, as described in the [health alerts page](health-alerts.md#ntlm-auditing-is-not-enabled).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## September 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.191

Released September 19, 2022

- **More activities to trigger honeytoken alerts**  
Microsoft Defender for Identity offers the ability to define honeytoken accounts, which are used as traps for malicious actors. Any authentication associated with these honeytoken accounts (normally dormant), triggers a honeytoken activity (external ID 2014) alert. New for this version, any LDAP or SAMR query against these honeytoken accounts will trigger an alert. In addition, if event 5136 is audited, an alert will be triggered when one of the attributes of the honeytoken was changed or if the group membership of the honeytoken was changed.

 For more information, see [Configure Windows Event collection](deploy/configure-windows-event-collection.md).

### Defender for Identity release 2.190

Released September 11, 2022

- **Updated assessment: Unsecure domain configurations**  
The unsecure domain configuration assessment available through Microsoft Secure Score now assesses the domain controller LDAP signing policy configuration and alerts if it finds an unsecure configuration. For more information, see [Security assessment: Unsecure domain configurations](security-assessment-unsecure-domain-configurations.md).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.189

Released September 4, 2022

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## August 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.188

Released August 28, 2022

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.187

Released August 18, 2022

- We have changed some of the logic behind how we trigger the [Suspected DCSync attack (replication of directory services) (external ID 2006)](domain-dominance-alerts.md#suspected-dcsync-attack-replication-of-directory-services-external-id-2006) alert. This detector now covers cases where the source IP address seen by the sensor appears to be a NAT device.

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.186

Released August 10, 2022

- Health alerts will now show the sensor's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of the NetBIOS name.

- New health alerts are available for capturing component type and configuration, as described in the [health alerts page](health-alerts.md#sensor-has-issues-with-packet-capturing-component).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## July 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.185

Released July 18, 2022

- An issue was fixed where [Suspected Golden Ticket usage (nonexistent account) (external ID 2027)](domain-dominance-alerts.md#suspected-golden-ticket-usage-nonexistent-account-external-id-2027) would wrongfully detect macOS devices.

- User actions: We've decided to divide the **Disable User** action on the user page into two different actions:
  - Disable User – which disables the user on the Active Directory level
  - Suspend User – which disables the user on the Azure Active Directory level

  We understand that the time it takes to sync from Active Directory to Azure Active Directory can be crucial, so now you can choose to disable users in one after the other, to remove the dependency on the sync itself. Note that a user disabled only in Azure Active Directory will be overwritten by Active Directory, if the user is still active there.

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.184

Released July 10, 2022

- **New security assessments**  
Defender for Identity now includes the following new security assessment:
  - Unsecure domain configurations  
Microsoft Defender for Identity continuously monitors your environment to identify domains with configuration values that expose a security risk, and reports on these domains to assist you in protecting your environment. For more information, see [Security assessment: Unsecure domain configurations](security-assessment-unsecure-domain-configurations.md).

- The Defender for Identity installation package will now install the Npcap component instead of the WinPcap drivers. For more information, see [WinPcap and Npcap drivers](/defender-for-identity/technical-faq#winpcap-and-npcap-drivers).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## June 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.183.15436.10558 (Hotfix)

Released June 20, 2022 (updated July 4, 2022)

- New security alert: Suspected DFSCoerce attack using Distributed File System Protocol  
In response to the publishing of a recent attack tool that leverages a flow in the DFS protocol, Microsoft Defender for Identity will trigger a security alert whenever an attacker is using this attack method. To learn more about this attack, [read the blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/how-microsoft-defender-for-identity-protects-against-dfscoerce/ba-p/3562912).

### Defender for Identity release 2.183

Released June 20, 2022

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.182

Released June 4, 2022

- A new **About** page for Defender for Identity is available. You can find it in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), under **Settings** -> **Identities** -> **About**. It provides several important details about your Defender for Identity workspace, including the workspace name, version, ID and the geolocation of your workspace. This information can be helpful when troubleshooting issues and opening support tickets.
- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## May 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.181

Released May 22, 2022

- You can now take [remediation actions](remediation-actions.md) directly on your on-premises accounts, using Microsoft Defender for Identity.
  - **Disable user** – This temporarily prevents a user from logging in to the network. It can help prevent compromised users from moving laterally and attempting to exfiltrate data or further compromise the network.
  - **Reset user password** – This prompts the user to change their password at the next sign-in, ensuring that this account can't be used for further impersonation attempts.

  These actions can be performed from several locations in Microsoft 365 Defender: the user page, the user page side panel, advanced hunting, and even custom detections. This requires setting up a privileged gMSA account that Microsoft Defender for Identity will use to perform the actions. For more information about the requirements, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity action accounts](deploy/manage-action-accounts.md).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.180

Released May 12, 2022

- New security alert: Suspicious modification of a dNSHostName attribute (CVE-2022-26923)  
In response to the publishing of a recent CVE, Microsoft Defender for Identity will trigger a security alert whenever an attacker is trying to exploit CVE-2022 -26923. To learn more about this attack, read [the blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/detecting-dnshostname-spoofing-with-microsoft-defender-for/ba-p/3352349).

- In version 2.177, we released additional LDAP activities that can be covered by Defender for Identity. However, we found a bug that causes the events not to be presented and ingested in the Defender for Identity portal. This has been fixed in this release. From version 2.180 onward, when you enable event ID 1644 you don't just get visibility into LDAP activities over Active Directory Web Services, but also other LDAP activities will include  the user who performed the LDAP activity on the source computer. This applies for security alerts and logical activities that are based on LDAP events.

- As a response to the recent KrbRelayUp exploitation, we've released a silent detector to help us evaluate our response to this exploitation. The silent detector will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the detection, and gather information based on events we're collecting. If this detection will be shown to be in high quality, we'll release a new security alert in the next version.

- We've renamed **Remote code execution over DNS** to **Remote code execution attempt over DNS**, as it better reflects the logic behind these security alerts.

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.179

### Defender for Identity release 2.177

Released March 27, 2022

- Microsoft Defender for Identity can now monitor additional LDAP queries in your network. These LDAP activities are sent over the Active Directory Web Service protocol and act like normal LDAP queries. To have visibility into these activities, you need to enable event 1644 on your domain controllers. This event covers LDAP activities in your domain and is primarily used to identify expensive, inefficient, or slow Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) searches that are serviced by Active Directory domain controllers. To learn how to enable this event, see [Event ID 1644](deploy/configure-windows-event-collection.md#configure-auditing-for-extra-ldap-queries).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.176

Released March 16, 2022

## February 2019

### Azure ATP release 2.67

Released February 24, 2019

- **New security alert: Security principal reconnaissance (LDAP) – (preview)**  
Azure ATP's [Security principal reconnaissance (LDAP) - preview](reconnaissance-alerts.md#security-principal-reconnaissance-ldap-external-id-2038) security alert is now in public preview.    In this detection, an Azure ATP security alert is triggered when security principal reconnaissance is used by attackers to gain critical information about the domain environment. This information helps attackers map the domain structure, as well as identify privileged accounts for use in later steps in their attack kill chain.

    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is one the most popular methods used for both legitimate and malicious purposes to query Active Directory. LDAP focused security principal reconnaissance is commonly used as the first phase of a Kerberoasting attack. Kerberoasting attacks are used to get a target list of Security Principal Names (SPNs), which attackers then attempt to get Ticket Granting Server (TGS) tickets for.

- **Feature enhancement: Account enumeration reconnaissance (NTLM) alert**  
Improved **Account enumeration reconnaissance (NTLM)** alert using additional analysis, and improved detection logic to reduce **B-TP** and **FP** alert results.

# Persistence and privilege escalation alerts

Typically, cyberattacks are launched against any accessible entity, such as a low-privileged user, and then quickly move laterally until the attacker gains access to valuable assets. Valuable assets can be sensitive accounts, domain administrators, or highly sensitive data. Microsoft Defender for Identity identifies these advanced threats at the source throughout the entire attack kill chain and classifies them into the following phases:

1. [Reconnaissance and discovery alerts](reconnaissance-discovery-alerts.md)
1. **Persistence and privilege escalation**
1. [Credential access alerts](credential-access-alerts.md)
1. [Lateral movement alerts](lateral-movement-alerts.md)
1. [Other alerts](other-alerts.md)

To learn more about how to understand the structure, and common components of all Defender for Identity security alerts, see [Understanding security alerts](understanding-security-alerts.md). For information about **True positive (TP)**, **Benign true positive (B-TP)**, and **False positive (FP)**, see [security alert classifications](understanding-security-alerts.md#security-alert-classifications).

The following security alerts help you identify and remediate **Persistence and privilege escalation** phase suspicious activities detected by Defender for Identity in your network.

After the attacker uses techniques to keep access to different on-premise resources they start the Privilege Escalation phase, which consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.

## Suspected Golden Ticket usage (encryption downgrade) (external ID 2009)

*Previous name:* Encryption downgrade activity

**Severity**: Medium

**Description**:

Encryption downgrade is a method of weakening Kerberos by downgrading the encryption level of different protocol fields that normally have the highest level of encryption. A weakened encrypted field can be an easier target to offline brute force attempts. Various attack methods utilize weak Kerberos encryption cyphers. In this detection, Defender for Identity learns the Kerberos encryption types used by computers and users, and alerts you when a weaker cypher is used that is unusual for the source computer and/or user and matches known attack techniques.

In a Golden Ticket alert, the encryption method of the TGT field of TGS_REQ (service request) message from the source computer was detected as downgraded compared to the previously learned behavior. This is not based on a time anomaly (as in the other Golden Ticket detection). In addition, in the case of this alert, there was no Kerberos authentication request associated with the previous service request, detected by Defender for Identity.

**Learning period**:

This alert has a learning period of 5 days from the start of domain controller monitoring.

## Suspected Golden Ticket usage (nonexistent account) (external ID 2027)

Previous name: Kerberos golden ticket

**Severity**: High

**Description**:

Attackers with domain admin rights can compromise the KRBTGT account. Using the KRBTGT account, they can create a Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) that provides authorization to any resource and set the ticket expiration to any arbitrary time. This fake TGT is called a "Golden Ticket" and allows attackers to achieve network persistence. In this detection, an alert is triggered by a nonexistent account.

**Learning period**:

None

## Suspected Golden Ticket usage (ticket anomaly) (external ID 2032)

**Severity**: High

**Description**:

Attackers with domain admin rights can compromise the KRBTGT account. Using the KRBTGT account, they can create a Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) that provides authorization to any resource and set the ticket expiration to any arbitrary time. This fake TGT is called a "Golden Ticket" and allows attackers to achieve network persistence. Forged Golden Tickets of this type have unique characteristics this detection is specifically designed to identify.

## Suspected Golden Ticket usage (ticket anomaly using RBCD) (external ID 2040)

**Severity**: High

**Description**:

Attackers with domain admin rights can compromise the KRBTGT account. Using the KRBTGT account, they can create a Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) that provides authorization to any resource. This fake TGT is called a "Golden Ticket" and allows attackers to achieve network persistence. In this detection, the alert is triggered by a golden ticket that was created by setting Resource Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) permissions using the KRBTGT account for account (user\computer) with SPN.

**Learning period**:

None

## Suspected Golden Ticket usage (time anomaly) (external ID 2022)

Previous name: Kerberos golden ticket

**Severity**: High

**Description**:

Attackers with domain admin rights can compromise the KRBTGT account. Using the KRBTGT account, they can create a Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) that provides authorization to any resource and set the ticket expiration to any arbitrary time. This fake TGT is called a "Golden Ticket" and allows attackers to achieve network persistence. This alert is triggered when a Kerberos ticket granting ticket is used for more than the allowed time permitted, as specified in the Maximum lifetime for user ticket.

**Learning period**:

None

## Suspected skeleton key attack (encryption downgrade) (external ID 2010)

*Previous name:* Encryption downgrade activity

**Severity**: Medium

**Description**:

Encryption downgrade is a method of weakening Kerberos using a downgraded encryption level for different fields of the protocol that normally have the highest level of encryption. A weakened encrypted field can be an easier target to offline brute force attempts. Various attack methods utilize weak Kerberos encryption cyphers. In this detection, Defender for Identity learns the Kerberos encryption types used by computers and users. The alert is issued when a weaker cypher is used that is unusual for the source computer, and/or user, and matches known attack techniques.

Skeleton Key is malware that runs on domain controllers and allows authentication to the domain with any account without knowing its password. This malware often uses weaker encryption algorithms to hash the user's passwords on the domain controller. In this alert, the learned behavior of previous KRB_ERR message encryption from domain controller to the account requesting a ticket, was downgraded.

**Learning period**:

None

**MITRE**:

|Primary MITRE tactic  | [Persistence (TA0003)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003)  |

|MITRE attack sub-technique |  [Domain Controller Authentication (T1556.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/001/)       |

## Suspicious additions to sensitive groups (external ID 2024)

**Severity**: Medium

**Description**:

Attackers add users to highly privileged groups. Adding users is done to gain access to more resources, and gain persistency. This detection relies on profiling the group modification activities of users, and alerting when an abnormal addition to a sensitive group is seen. Defender for Identity profiles continuously.

For a definition of sensitive groups in Defender for Identity, see [Working with the sensitive accounts](/defender-for-identity/entity-tags).

The detection relies on events audited on domain controllers. Make sure your domain controllers are [auditing the events needed](deploy/configure-windows-event-collection.md).

**Learning period**:

Four weeks per domain controller, starting from the first event.

**MITRE**:

|Primary MITRE tactic  | [Persistence (TA0003)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) |
|---------|---------|
|Secondary MITRE tactic    | [Credential Access (TA0006)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006)        |
|MITRE attack technique  |  [Account Manipulation (T1098)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/),[Domain Policy Modification (T1484)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/)      |
|MITRE attack sub-technique | N/A        |

**Suggested steps for prevention**:

1. To help prevent future attacks, minimize the number of users authorized to modify sensitive groups.
1. Set up Privileged Access Management for Active Directory if applicable.

## Suspected Netlogon privilege elevation attempt (CVE-2020-1472 exploitation) (external ID 2411)

**Severity**: High

**Description**:
Microsoft published [CVE-2020-1472](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472) announcing that a new vulnerability exists that allows the elevation of privileges to the domain controller.

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol ([MS-NRPC](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-nrpc/ff8f970f-3e37-40f7-bd4b-af7336e4792f)), also known as *Netlogon Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability*.

**Learning period**:

None

**MITRE**:

|Primary MITRE tactic  | [Privilege Escalation (TA0004)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004)  |
|---------|---------|
|MITRE attack technique | N/A        |
|MITRE attack sub-technique | N/A        |

**Suggested steps for prevention**:

1. Review [our guidance](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4557222/how-to-manage-the-changes-in-netlogon-secure-channel-connections-assoc) on managing changes in Netlogon secure channel connection which relate to and can prevent this vulnerability.

## Honeytoken user attributes modified (external ID 2427)

**Severity**: High

**Description**:
Every user object in Active Directory has attributes that contain information such as first name, middle name, last name, phone number, address and more. Sometimes attackers will try and manipulate these objects for their benefit, for example by changing the phone number of an account to get access to any multifactor authentication attempt. Microsoft Defender for Identity will trigger this alert for any attribute modification against a pre-configured [honeytoken user](classic-manage-sensitive-honeytoken-accounts.md).

**Learning period**:

None

**MITRE**:

|Primary MITRE tactic  | [Persistence (TA0003)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003)  |
|---------|---------|
|MITRE attack technique  |  [Account Manipulation (T1098)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/)     |
|MITRE attack sub-technique | N/A        |

## Honeytoken group membership changed (external ID 2428)

**Severity**: High

**Description**:
In Active Directory, each user is a member of one or more groups. After gaining access to an account, attackers may attempt to add or remove permissions from it to other users, by removing or adding them to security groups. Microsoft Defender for Identity triggers an alert whenever there is a change made to a preconfigured [honeytoken user account](classic-manage-sensitive-honeytoken-accounts.md).

**Learning period**:

None

**MITRE**:

|Primary MITRE tactic  | [Persistence (TA0003)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003)  |
|---------|---------|
|MITRE attack technique  |  [Account Manipulation (T1098)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/)     |
|MITRE attack sub-technique | N/A        |

## Suspected SID-History injection (external ID 1106)

**Severity**: High

**Description**:
SIDHistory is an attribute in Active Directory that allows users to retain their permissions and access to resources when their account is migrated from one domain to another. When a user account is migrated to a new domain, the user's SID is added to the SIDHistory attribute of their account in the new domain. This attribute contains a list of SIDs from the user's previous domain.

Adversaries may use the SIH history injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. This detection will trigger when newly added SID was added to the SIDHistory attribute.

**Learning period**:

None

**MITRE**:

|Primary MITRE tactic  |[Privilege Escalation (TA0004)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004)  |
